# k3s Appliance Installer

Single-command installer for VM / bare-metal customers. Turns a Linux host
into a Fabric-connected appliance by installing k3s underneath and deploying
the Connect Agent as a DaemonSet inside it.

## Why k3s (even for a single Agent)?

| Without k3s (plain systemd) | With k3s |
|---|---|
| Process-alive restart only | Liveness + readiness probes |
| No resource limits | CPU/memory limits enforced |
| Stop-then-start updates | Rolling zero-downtime updates |
| Separate identity file management | K8s-Secret-based identity (same as full K8s) |
| Different packaging path | Same manifests as K8s customers |

## Usage

`--ca-url` points at `GET /v1/ca-bundle` on the control plane — shipped,
unauthenticated by design (a CA certificate is trust-anchor material meant
to be distributed, not a secret; the private key never leaves the
Platform). Use `--ca-file` instead if you'd rather ship the CA cert
pre-baked into the install bundle.

```bash
# Direct install (downloads k3s + deploys Agent):
curl -sSL https://install.fabric.abluva.io | sh -s -- \
  --token=<BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN> \
  --gateway=fabric.platform.example.com:8443 \
  --control-plane=https://cp.platform.example.com \
  --tenant-id=<TENANT_UUID> \
  --ca-url=https://cp.platform.example.com/v1/ca-bundle

# Or from a local copy with an env file:
./install.sh --env-file=./fabric-edge.env

# Custom Agent image:
./install.sh --env-file=./fabric-edge.env --image=registry.example.com/connect-agent:v1.2.3
```

## After Install

```bash
# Status
k3s kubectl -n fabric-edge get pods

# Logs
k3s kubectl -n fabric-edge logs -l app=connect-agent --tail=50

# Approve in UI, then create registrations
# Apps (as pods on this k3s) dial:
#   connect-agent.fabric-edge.svc.cluster.local:<port>
# Port map:
#   k3s kubectl -n fabric-edge get svc connect-agent \
#     -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.fabric\.abluva\.io/registration-ports}'
# (Host-OS apps need NodePort/hostPort — ClusterIP is in-cluster only.)
```

## Uninstall

```bash
/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```

This removes k3s, its data, and all Fabric components cleanly.

## How It Works

1. Installs k3s with `--disable=traefik,servicelb,metrics-server` (minimal
   footprint — we don't need ingress or external load balancers on a
   single-host appliance)
2. Creates namespace `fabric-edge` with RBAC for Secret + Service management
3. Deploys the same `connect-agent` DaemonSet manifest as the full K8s path,
   with `FABRIC_IDENTITY_STORE=kubernetes` (per-node Secret for identity)
4. Applies sibling `agent/agent-deployment.yaml` and `privacy/privacy-deployment.yaml` (`<tenant-namespace>`, `<tenantId>`, `<envid>`), then tenant NetworkPolicy
5. Waits for the Connect Agent pod to reach Running state

The customer never needs to interact with k3s directly. `k3s kubectl` is
available for debugging, but the normal path is: install → approve in UI →
create registrations → apps dial `connect-agent.fabric-edge.svc…:<port>`.

## Environment File Format

See `fabric-edge.env.example`. Same variables as the K8s `tenant-start.env`,
just consumed by this installer instead.

## Requirements

- **Linux** host (amd64 or arm64). The appliance installer embeds **k3s**
  (Kubernetes) and deploys the Connect Agent as a DaemonSet — this is **not**
  the plain `systemd/` single-binary Agent path. Linux is required because
  **k3s** needs it (k3s registers a systemd unit under the hood). You still
  get K8s-Secret identity, probes, and rolling updates — same as full K8s.
- Root access (k3s install)
- curl
- Outbound TCP to the Gateway host:**port** in `FABRIC_GATEWAY_ADDRESS`
  (typically **8443**) and HTTPS to `FABRIC_CONTROL_PLANE_URL`
- ~60MB disk for k3s + ~100MB for Agent image

**Canonical E2E (OCI OKE Platform → Linux VM customer):**  
[`docs/Operational-Runbook.md`](../../../../docs/Operational-Runbook.md) →
**End-to-end: OCI (OKE) + Linux VM (k3s appliance)**.
